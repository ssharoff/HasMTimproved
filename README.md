# HasMTimproved

This is an updated version of the website originally created by W John Hutchins, see his Wikipedia entry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._John_Hutchins

John has collected early examples of MT output, starting from French-English punchcard simulations by Richens and Booth from 1948, through actual Georgetown University and IBM-USAF Russian-English translations from  the 1960s to MT systems from the early 2000s.

See a separate [list of links](file-list.html) to outputs.


You can compare them with the most recent neural MT outputs from Bing and Google.
