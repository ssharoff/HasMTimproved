# HasMTimproved

This is an updated version of the website originally created by W John Hutchins, see his Wikipedia entry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._John_Hutchins

John has collected early examples of MT output, starting from French-English punchcard simulations by Richens and Booth from 1948, through actual Georgetown University and IBM-USAF Russian-English translations from  the 1960s to MT systems from the early 2000s.

See [file-list.org](the list of systems with published outputs).

The files provide:

-   A :: the original source texts
-   B :: the unedited output from the respective early systems
-   C :: examples of translations of the same source text (A) in a selection of commercial systems as of 2003 done by John Hutchins

You can compare them with the most recent neural MT outputs from Bing and Google.
