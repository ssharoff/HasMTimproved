Example 4.
A. Original French text 
Au fil du temps, on peut s’attendre à un certain comblement de l’écart par le taux relativement élevé de l’inflation, qui ne sera pas entièrement compensé par la dévaluation de la monnaie et par la hausse des prix agricoles intérieurs, vu que la demande de denrées alimentaires augmente un peu plus vite que l’offre.
B (a). Unedited output from Systran, 1987
	To the wire of the time, one can expect certain filling of the divergence by the relatively raised rate of the inflation, which entirely will not be compensated by the devaluation of the currency and by the increase in the domestic farm prices, since the request for foodstuffs increases more quickly a little than the offer.
B (b). Unedited output from Systran, 1997
