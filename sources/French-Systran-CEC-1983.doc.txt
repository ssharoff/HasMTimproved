Example 1
A. Original French text
	Où en est-on, environ un an après la réunion du Comité permanent de l’emploi? A l’époque, les organisations syndicales avaient estimé que la Commission européenne prenait le problème par le petit bout de la lorgnette, sans le situer dans le contexte d’une stratégie globale et d’une politique industrielle plus dynamique. Il faut partager le travail, réduire le temps de travail, mais ce n’est là qu’un palliatif.
En tant que syndicaliste réaliste et pragmatique, l’orateur se déclare prêt à manger des merles à défaut de grives. Mais va-t-on se contenter d’émettre des voeux ou de formuler des recommandations? Cela ne serait que de l’eau bénite de coeur, alors qu’il faut empoigner le taureau par les cornes, c’est-à-dire réunir les partenaires sociaux au niveau communautaire. En Belgique, le monde patronal estime être en avance en matière de réduction du temps de travail et, par conséquent, être désavantagé par rapport aux pays voisins. Une harmonisation au niveau européen est donc indispensable.

	How far was, approximately a year after the meeting of the Standing Committee on Employment? At the time, the trade-union organizations had felt that the Commission had taken the problem by the small end of the lorgnette, without locating it in the context of a total strategy and of a politique industrial more dynamic. It was necessary to share work, to reduce the working time, but it was there only one palliative.
	As realistic and pragmatic trade unionist, the speaker declared himself ready to eat blackbirds in the absence of grives. But one would restrict himself expressing wishes or to making recommendations? That would be only of bénite the water of court, whereas it was necessary empoigner the bull by the horns, i..e to bring together the two sides of industry at community level. In Belgium, the employers’ world estimated to be in advance as regards reduction of the working time and, consequently, to be handicapped compared to the close countries. A harmonization at the European level was thus essential.

Example 2
A. Original French text
M. le Président rappelle que le problème de la réduction du temps de travail a été étudié à la réunion de Munich. Différentes thèses s’affrontent: pour les syndicats, la réduction du temps de travail contribuera à supprimer le chômage, mais les employeurs pensent qu’elle supprimera des emplois soit en renchérissant les coûts, soit en accroissant la productivité. Il serait souhaitable de poursuivre aujourd’hui cette discussion en laissant de côté tous les présupposés idéologiques. Pour commencer, il convient de demander au représentant de la Commission européenne, qui a réussi à rejoindre Luxembourg malgré un mouvement de grève à Bruxelles, s’il souhaite compléter l’exposé qu’il avait présenté à Munich.

	The Chairman reminded the meeting that the problem of the reduction of the working time had been studied to the meeting of Munich. Various theses faced themselves: for the trade unions, the reduction of the working time would contribute to suppress unemployment, but the employers thought that she would suppress an employment either by increasing the costs, or by increasing the productivity. It would be desirable to continue today this discussion by leaving some on the side of all ideological presupposed them. To start, it was advisable to require from the European Commission representative, which had succeeded in joining Luxembourg despite a strike movement in Brussels, if it wished to supplement the statement that it had presented in Munich.
