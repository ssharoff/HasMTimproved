Other examples of translations – without original Russian – by the system were quoted in the ALPAC report 1966, p.23:
	“The reader will find it instructive to compare the samples above [from Bunker-Ramo, Computer Concepts, FTD and Euratom] with the results obtained on a simple, or selected, text 10 years earlier (the Georgetown IBM Experiment, January 7, 1954) in that the earlier samples are more readable than the later ones.
	The quality of crude oil is determined by calory content.
	The quality of saltpeter is determined by chemical methods.
	TNT is produced from coal.
	They obtain dynamite from nitroglycerine.
	Ammonite is obtained from saltpeter.
	Gasoline is prepared by chemical methods from crude oil.
	They prepare ammonite.
	Gasoline is produced by chemical methods from crude oil.
	The price of crude oil is determined by the market.
	Calory content determines the quality of crude oil.
	TNT is prepared from coal.”
The ALPAC report does not state when these translations were done. The sentences were not included in those listed by Garvin in 1967 [see above]. However, each of them would have been feasible with the rules and vocabulary entries he described.
